ZenMux is the world's first enterprise-grade model aggregation platform that offers AI model insurance services. We not only provide developers with a unified API to access leading large language models worldwide, but also automatically select the optimal model via intelligent routing algorithms and offer insurance-backed safeguards for AI output quality (coming soon), comprehensively addressing enterprise concerns about AI hallucinations and output instability.

With ZenMux, developers can call models from providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and DeepSeek through a single interface, while benefiting from intelligent routing, failover, and insurance-backed quality assurance services.
